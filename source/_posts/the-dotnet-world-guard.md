I want to introduce a high-performance, extensible argument validation library.

`Guard` is a fluent argument validation library that is intuitive, fast and extensible. `Guard` takes advantage of almost all the new features introduced in `C# 7.2`.

<!-- more -->

Install the below package

```bash
Install-Package Dawn.Guard -Version 1.12.0
dotnet add package Dawn.Guard --version 1.12.0
<PackageReference Include="Dawn.Guard" Version="1.12.0" />
```
